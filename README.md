# Hydrodynamics-of-Linked-model-micro-swimmers

## Introduction

In macroscopic swimming, inertia plays a key role in locomotion. However, in the microscopic world, where viscous forces dominate, different principles apply. This project aims to understand how linked micro-swimmers achieve movement in such low Reynolds number environments by breaking time-reversal symmetry.

## Objectives

- Develop a mathematical model for micro-swimmer locomotion.
- Explore various configurations to determine their impact on movement.
- Identify parameters that can enhance micro-swimmer efficiency, potentially benefiting biomedical applications.

## Methodology

### 2 Spheres, 1 Active Link
- **Objective:** Study harmonic deformation of the active link.
- **Findings:** Net displacement is zero due to the scallop theorem, demonstrating that a single degree of freedom is insufficient for locomotion.

### 3 Spheres, 2 Active Links (without Oseen interactions)
- **Objective:** Examine the impact of additional degrees of freedom.
- **Findings:** No net displacement observed, indicating the necessity of Oseen interactions for effective propulsion.

### 3 Spheres, 2 Active Links (with Oseen interactions)
- **Objective:** Investigate the role of hydrodynamic interactions.
- **Findings:** Net displacement achieved, confirming theoretical models. The configuration and deformation mechanisms significantly impact locomotion.

## Key Findings and Impact

- **Asymmetry in Resting Lengths:** Greater asymmetry leads to more significant displacement. This insight is crucial for designing efficient micro-swimmers.
- **State Contributions:** Most contracted states within the deformation cycle contribute the most to net displacement. This understanding can be applied to optimize the motion patterns of artificial micro-swimmers.
- **Orientation Independence:** The swimmerâ€™s orientation does not affect locomotion; only the deformation mechanism does, simplifying design constraints.

### Practical Applications
- **Biomedical Engineering:** The findings on Oseen interactions and deformation mechanisms can enhance the design of microbots for targeted drug delivery, potentially leading to more effective and efficient treatments.
- **Robotic Design:** The insights gained from this study can be applied to develop small-scale robots for various industrial applications, where precise control and efficient movement are essential.

## Future Work

- Detailed analysis of configurations with one active and one elastic link.
- Further exploration of additional deformation mechanisms to enhance locomotion efficiency.
